his year I took a deep-dive into rust programming and solved advent of code with it. After a _very_ steep learning curve (only coded with languages with automatic GC in the past) I'm now at the point where I enjoy coding in rust. One of rusts perks is that you can compile to different targets independent of the machine (e.g. creating an amd64 windows binary on an arm mac). It also has great support for webassembly. That allowed me to have my code run in the browser without much refactoring.

Shout out to [Chris Biscardi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/main/2024/rust) who created a nice template and helpers to get you started for every day.
